This is an EDA performed on the dataset Pisa Scores 2013-2015.csv.

The EDA Performed with code can be found [here](https://rpubs.com/shikharkrdixit/753448)

PISA stands for "Program for International Student Assessment" and it is applied to 15 year-old students across the world to assess their performance in Math, Reading and Science. Here, I have tried to analyze and explore the dataset and resultantly infer some meaningful insights from it.

The libraries I used in this process are:

1. **tidyverse** cleaning of the datase and performing some transitions.
2. **ggplot2** for plotting.
3. **corrplot** for the correlation plot.
4. **Hmisc** for cor and rcorr functions to find correlation and finding the P-values.
5. **ggmap** for retrieving map tiles from online servies.

## Process:

- [x] **Data Loading.**

- [x] **Data Pre-processing.**

- [x] **Visualization.**
